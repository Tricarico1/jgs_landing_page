**Compliance**

· Increased and expanding regulations (EPA and state) 

· Nutrient removal (improved operations typically with more skilled staff)

· Chemical and biological methods (chemical methods applicable if adequate biological or physical plant methods don’t exist)

**Value of water**

· Scarcity (ever increasing scarcity due to human activity as well as climate change)

· Reuse direct and indirect (direct reuse is quickly going from option to necessity)

**Staff**

· Aging workforce (the average age of wastewater treatment operators is 56)

· Technology changes (need to make industry more attractive to younger group that embraces technology)

· Attract from other industries (other industries have people that would fit in well, need to have wastewater industry viewed as more technological, required more skilled labor)

· More training (technological training)

**Funding**

· Operating costs (energy, sludge disposal)

· Infrastructure (collection system, pump stations, technology)

· Combined sewers (separate, cost of operation with wet weather flows)

· ROI (upgrades last longer than payback time)

· Simplified repairs and/or upgrades that allow for continued permit compliance

· Utility rate affordability (operating and infrastructure costs increasing utility rates)

**Background**

The ozone/cavitation process has proven beneficial for effective treatment of potable water source waters. Although these successes have largely been for disinfection purposes, the ozone process has afforded owners of this type of treatment system several ancillary benefits such as removal of taste and odor source contaminants as well as natural and manmade organics, including pesticides and herbicides. This process is capable of oxidizing a large portion of refractory type pollutants often found in both water and wastewater. Removal of these pollutants in either case is beneficial as often times the potable water plants draw water out of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, etc. containing treated water from a wastewater treatment plant. Although the functionality of some of the more conventional methods may have merit they may not be a viable due to, among other things; regulatory requirements, economics and/or available space. Due to more recent advancements in water and wastewater treatment technologies, these refractory type pollutants can, and often times are, more cost effectively removed through less conventional methods. One of the more efficient technologies in this regard is the cavitation/ozone process.

**Cavitation**


First of all, as the name implies, there are two complementary technologies that are the basis for this treatment process, cavitation and ozone. They work in tandem to disrupt, oxidize and then further disrupt and oxidize pollutants contained in the liquid simultaneously. Energy added to a liquid first causes small bubbles to be created and upon reaching the critical point collapse radiating energy. Energy provided by the cavitation process produces extremely high localized temperatures and pressures, on the order of 11,100oC and 29,000 psi respectively. These conditions make it possible to further some oxidation reactions as well as allowing some oxidation reactions to occur that would ordinarily be impossible. 

Cavitation and its role in various water and wastewater treatment processes have become increasingly relevant. Cavitation improves ozone treatment primarily through its ability to enable more efficient breakdown of pollutants subsequent to more efficient ozone application and treatment. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this ozone/cavitation process hybrid technology, when compared to ozone as a standalone technology, is the improvement on effective treatment capacity by a factor of three to one. When considering minimal cavitation related energy cost demands in relation to the cost of ozone treatment system and onsite ozone production, the ozone/cavitation process becomes a far more viable alternative to other existing technologies.
